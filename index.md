# status.tildeverse.org

this site is a static status page for tildeverse.org. 

a good portion of tildeverse services are hosted on tilde.team, including the main site.

tilde.team is probably up, but if it's not, and you wound up here because of that, here are some places you can look for more info:

- `#meta` or `#team` on [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat)
- `#tilde.team` on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat) (in the case that tilde.chat is down)
